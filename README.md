# FlipDash

I was tinkering around with gemini when it asked me if I wanted to create a game together. the day before while looking for something else in my google drive I came across a description of a simple game that I guess I had wanted to make back in 2014. I figured it would be fun to see if I could vibe code with gemini to do its implementation.

initial prompt:

```
lets make a web game together. Here is the idea

# FlipDash

Obviously this is similar to FlappyBirdâ€¦

## **Game concept**

User must navigate through obstacles as long as possible. The more obstacles passed, the higher the score. The user stays at the bottom of the screen while obstacles come down from the top of the screen (the user may view it as the obstacles being stationary while they move up). The obstacles will not be aligned, forcing the user to strafe left and right to align with them. Each obstacle will be one of two colors. The user must *flip* over to change its color to match the obstacle so they can pass through unharmed. This game will only be fun if there is a good balance in how fast the obstacles move and how much leeway to get through the hold. The game should be decently challenging to keep the user coming back. The focus is to be as simple and clean as possible. We will target mobile phones.

## **Controls**

The user needs to be able to strafe left and right, and to *flip* color. During game play there will be 3 buttons along the bottom of the screen large enough to easy finger tapping. the rightmost button will cause the user to strafe right as long as it is held. The left will do the same in the opposite direction. tapping the middle button will cause the user to *flip* over, changing color.

## **Main Screens**

The application will start by going to the title screen, consisting of a basic splash screen long with a button to rate the game, start gameplay or review scores. After choosing to play, the user will be taken to the game screen where they will navigate the obstacles. When the user crashes, they will be taken to the score screen where they will again have the option to jump back into the game.
```

from there I asked it to create a project plan with tasks to lay out all of the steps we will need to completion and then let it do its thing. I was trying to see how far I could get with just vibe coding so I purposely did not write or modify the code in any way. I was just the play tester, and also for the most part I would simple say "great. lets jump to the next step" and I let it decide what it should do next.

attached you will find the final version of the project plan and the generated html that is the game. not bad!
